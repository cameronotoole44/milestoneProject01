## About the Project

This Blackjack game is my first milestone project, created to demonstrate my foundational knowledge of web development. It's a classic Player vs. Dealer game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Throughout the development process, I learned new concepts and picked up on certain creational patterns. Overcoming challenges, such as implementing the switching of Ace values and resolving UI issues, has been a rewarding experience.

## Features

- Player vs. Dealer gameplay
- Intuitive betting system
- Automated dealer turns
- Dynamic Ace value (11 or 1) based on hand total
- Responsive design (work in progress)

## How to Play

1. Place your bet using the betting buttons ($1, $5, $25, $100)
2. Click 'Deal' to start the round
3. Choose to 'Hit' for another card or 'Stand' to end your turn
4. The dealer will then play their hand (automatically hits until reaching at least 17)
5. Winner is determined, and you can start a new hand

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SCSS (on a separate branch)

## Future Improvements

- Implement 'Insurance', 'Split', and 'Double' features
- Add multiplayer functionality
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

## Known Issues

- Betting logic needs refinement
- Player's blackjack (21 on initial deal) not registering correctly
- False losses occurring in some scenarios
- Overall game logic and flow require thorough review and improvement
