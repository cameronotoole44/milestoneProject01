## Blackjack

This is my first milestone project, that will showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of this project was to create a browser game, using best practices and my foundational knowledge up until this point.  
I chose to create a game of Blackjack, a classic gamba game. Player vs. Dealer. Closest to 21 without going over wins.
Overall I had fun working on this, I learned a few new things and picked up on certain creational patterns which is pretty cool.  
The switching of the Ace values stumped me for a minute, but with enough research and patience, I'm proud I figured that one out.
I also ran into the issue of the Dealer's cards being duplicated in the UI in certain cases. I ended up creating individual card containers for them to match the number of cards in the Dealer's hand.

## Current WIP

- fix bets not updating after each hand
- total player money going up on a winning hand
- have the logic be more accurate given the complexity*

### Eventually

I plan on adding another player besides the 'Dealer'.  
 _if I'm feeling wild_ an 'Insurance', 'Split', 'Double' feature at some point.

### Functionality:

*Place bet by clicking bet buttons $1, $5, $25, $100. The player starts with $1000  
*Click 'Deal' to begin the round  
*Click 'Hit' to draw another card  
*Click 'Stand' to end turn  
\*Click 'New Hand' to start another round

### Features:

- Aces value switches from 11 to 1 if the player/dealer is over 21
- Dealers turn automated until the dealer hits at least 17
- Rules of Blackjack can be found : [Rules](https://cameronotoole44.github.io/milestoneProject01/rules/rules.html)
- Card Values : [Card Values](https://cameronotoole44.github.io/milestoneProject01/rules/cardValues.html)
