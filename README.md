# Milestone Project 01


## Blackjack

This is my first milestone project, that will showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of this project was to create a browser game, using best practices and my foundational knowledge up until this point.  
I chose to create a game of Blackjack, a classic gamba game. Player vs. Dealer.
Overall I had fun working on this, I learned a few new things and picked up on certain creational patterns which is pretty cool.  
The switching of the Ace values stumped me for a minute, but with enough research and patience, I'm proud I figured that one out.  

I plan on adding another player besides the 'Dealer'.  
 _if I'm feeling wild_ an 'Insurance', 'Split', 'Double' feature at some point.  


### Functionality-  

-Place bet by clicking bet buttons $1, $5, $25, $100. The player starts with $1000  
-Click 'Deal' to begin the round  
-Click 'Hit' to draw another card  
-Click 'Stand' to end turn  
-Click 'New Hand' to start another round  

* Aces value switch from 11 to 1 if the player/dealer is over 21  
* Dealers turn automated until the dealer hits at least 17  
* Rules of Blackjack can be found :   
* Card Values :
