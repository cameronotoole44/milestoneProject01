  "description": "This is my first milestone project, that will showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\r The goal of this project was to create a browser game, using best practices and my foundational knowledge up until this point.  \r I chose to create a game of Blackjack, a classic gamba game. Player vs. Dealer. Closest to 21 without going over wins.\r Overall I had fun working on this, I learned a few new things and picked up on certain creational patterns which is pretty cool.  \r The switching of the Ace values stumped me for a minute, but with enough research and patience, I'm proud I figured that one out.\r I also ran into the issue of the Dealer's cards being duplicated in the UI in certain cases. I ended up creating individual card containers for the to match the number of cards in the Dealer's hand.",
